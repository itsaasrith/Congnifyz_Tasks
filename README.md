This project aims to build a machine learning model that predicts the aggregate rating of a restaurant based on various features like cuisine type, city, price range, and user votes. This helps food delivery platforms and businesses better understand the key factors influencing customer satisfaction.
Our Objective is To develop a regression model that accurately predicts a restaurantâ€™s rating using structured restaurant metadata
The model successfully predicts ratings with reasonable accuracy. Feature importance and correlation analysis were used to identify the most influential factors.
